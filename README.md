# Reliable-and-Secure-Network-Communication-System
- Designed and implemented a reliable, bidirectional data transfer protocol over UDP as part of a class project under the guidance of Professor George Varghese.
- Ensured data integrity, sequencing, and flow control using C/C++ and BSD sockets.
- Developed a security layer with AES-256-CBC encryption, HMAC SHA-256 for authentication, and ECDSA/Diffie-Hellman for identity verification and key exchange.
- Incorporated TLS-like handshake protocols to establish encrypted connections with mutual authentication, preventing tampering and eavesdropping.
- Followed cryptographic standards such as HKDF key derivation, ASN.1 DER encoding, and TLV messaging for robust security and interoperability.
